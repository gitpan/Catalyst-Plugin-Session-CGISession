Catalyst-Plugin-Session-CGISession version 0.2

NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::CGISession - use CGI::Session for persistent
    session data

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst  qw{ ... Session::CGISession ... };

        MyApp->config->{session} = {
            expires   => 3600,
            rewrite   => 1,
        };

        $c->session->{foo} = 'bar';
        print $c->sessionid;


DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides the same functionality as the original
    Session::FastMmap plugin but uses the CGI::Session module for the
    session data management.

    The motivations to develop this plugin were:

    * provide better session data expiration handling, as is available
    through the CGI::Session module
    * provide an easier migration to Catalyst for applications that have
    been using CGI::Session and its param() and other methods
    * allow Windows users to avoid the workarounds needed to make
    Cache::FastMmap work

    The difference in session expiration between this plugin and
    Session::FastMmap is small but important. CGI::Session resets the
    expiration time limit on every access to the session. A one day time
    limit means the session data disappears 24 hours after the *last*
    request using that session. With Session::FastMmap the limit would be 24
    hours after the *first* request, when the session is created.

    While this plugin adds some functions and methods beyond those available
    with Session::FastMmap, new development most likely should avoid using
    these features. Try to use only the common feature, session(), to stay
    compatible with "Session::FastMmap" and other future session plugins.


DEPENDENCIES

  CGI::Session
    This module was developed using the first CGI::Session 4.00 release. It
    was subsequently tested under 3.95, the last 3.x version.

    Testing has been done using:

        Windows XP

            CGI::Session 4.00   'File' driver

            CGI::Session 4.00   MySQL 3.23.x

            CGI::Session 3.95   MySQL 3.23.x
                Note: driver name case sensitivity, e.g.
                    cgis_dsn: driver:MySQL;serializer:Storable;id:MD5
                Note: TableName not available, must use global variable, e.g.
                    $CGI::Session::MySQL::TABLE_NAME = 'myapp_sessions';

            CGI::Session 3.95   'File' driver
                Note: different global variable $CGI::Session::File::FileName

        Linux

            CGI::Session 3.95   'File' driver
                Note: this driver leaves session data tainted

            CGI::Session 3.95   MySQL 3.23.x

THANKS
    To Christian Hansen, from whose test program implementation of
    CGI::Session use I borrowed extensively,

    To Andy Grundman, for the solution to poking cookie values,

    To Sebastian Riedel and Marcus Ramberg, for the
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap module used to get me started,

    And to them and the rest of the contributors to Catalyst, for a great
    start!
