NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::CGISession - use CGI::Session for persistent
    session data

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst  qw{ ... Session::CGISession ... };

        MyApp->config->{session} = {
            expires   => 3600,
            rewrite   => 1,

DESCRIPTION


DEPENDENCIES
    This module was developed using the first CGI::Session 4.00 release. It
    was subsequently tested under 3.95, the last 3.x version.

    Testing has been done using:

        Windows XP

            CGI::Session 4.00   'File' driver

            CGI::Session 4.00   MySQL 3.23.x

            CGI::Session 3.95   MySQL 3.23.x
                Note: driver name case sensitivity, e.g.
                    cgis_dsn: driver:MySQL;serializer:Storable;id:MD5
                Note: TableName not available, must use global variable, e.g.
                    $CGI::Session::MySQL::TABLE_NAME = 'myapp_sessions';

            CGI::Session 3.95   'File' driver
                Note: different global variable $CGI::Session::File::FileName

        Linux

            Planned: 
            CGI::Session 3.95   'File' driver
            CGI::Session 3.95   MySQL 3.23.x
            CGI::Session 4.00   'File' driver
            CGI::Session 4.00   MySQL 3.23.x
